# Machine_component_failure_prediction

This ML model is developed to identify the the reasons for degraded performance or catastrophic failure of a component either, during component manufacturing and testing or after delivery to the customer at the final application.

This dataset reflects real component failure prediction encountered in the automobile and other industries with measurements from real equipment. The features description:-

The six features are: - 
Type: the quality of the product, consisting of a letter L, M, or H. Meaning low, medium, and high, respectively. 
Air temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process. 
Process temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process. 
Rotational speed [rpm]: calculated from power of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise. 
Torque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm 
Tool wear: The quality variants H/M/L of tool wear in the process.

Target: failure or no failure (to perform binary classification).
